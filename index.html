            <article>
                Hi, I'm Karl Choi, a game designer and developer from California. 
                I'm currently a 3rd year student at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) studying for a Bachelor's Degree in Game Design and Development. 
                I'm experienced with C#, Lua, and have worked with web languages such as HTML, CSS, & JavaScript.
                In terms of software, some that I have used include Unity, Visual Studio/Code, and Roblox Studio.
                As a game developer, I strive to make fun, challenging, and balanced games with the goal of one day becoming a succesful game designer/deveoper.
