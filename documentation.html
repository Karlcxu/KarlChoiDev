        <h2>Goal</h2>
        <p>My goal with this portfolio is to create a mordern looking portfolio useful for job applications and the presentation of my works.
        </p>

        <h2>Sources</h2>
        <p>For my font, I'm using Open Sans by Steve Matteson from Google Fonts.
        </p>

        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>My current portfolio spans 60% of the viewport width, and I decided to use 220px wide images to account for this. When the screen shrinks below 1200, 900, and 600px in width, my design changes to span 70%, 80%, and 85% of the vw respectively in
            order to implement responsive design. The images also grow whenever a breakpoint is reached [to 250, 280, 310px], and wrap rows so all images will always be visible on the screen. In addition, the gallery images are centered so they look in
            place even when there are only 1 or 2 out of the total 3 gallery images on screen.
