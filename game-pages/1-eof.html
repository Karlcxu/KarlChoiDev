            <h2>Game Info</h2>
            Edifice of Fiends is a challenging Singleplayer Roguelike RPG where every choice matters. The goal
            is to conquer each floor of the Edifice and climb to the top.
            <hr>There are over 15 different skills that the player can learn and over 40 different enemies that can
            spawn.
            <hr>Players grow stronger by purchasing items and distributing stat points they gain. The game contains
            over
            100 unique items that are randomly available, which makes each playthrough a fresh experience.

            <h2>My Experience</h2>
            I learned a lot from developing this game such as scope management, level design, and enemy design [over 40
            unique enemies].
            After publishing the game and watching players play, I was able to get a better understanding of how to
            design enemies that are interesting and
            challenging obstacles to players.

            <hr>The biggest challenge I faced was finishing and publishing the game. Since this was the first game
            I've ever published, I had trouble figuring out when to end the development process and get the build onto
            Steam.
            However, I did figure out both when to finish and how to publish, and the game was released shortly after.
