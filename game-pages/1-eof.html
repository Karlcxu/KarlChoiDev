            <h2>Game Info</h2>
            Edifice of Fiends is a challenging Singleplayer Rogue-Like Strategy RPG where every choice matters. The goal is to conquer each floor of the Edifice and climb to the top.
            <hr>In order to win, players must choose the best moves in each situation, and know when to strike. Players have more than 15 different skills they can learn which allow them to stun, cripple, and decimate their foes.
            With over 40 different enemies, players will always be kept on their toes about what to do next. 
            <hr>Also, as characteristic of RPG's, players can grow stronger by purchasing items. The game contains over 100 unique items that appear randomly, which makes each playthrough a fresh experience.

            <h2>My Experience</h2>
            I learned many things from this project such as scope management, level designs, and enemy designs. Developing this game helped me get a better understanding of how to design enemies that are interesting and challenging obstacles to the player.

            <hr>Some challenges I overcame include finishing and publishing the game. Since this was the first game I've ever published, I had trouble figuring out when to end the development process and get the build onto Steam. 
            However, I eventually figured both of those things out and the game was published shortly after.
