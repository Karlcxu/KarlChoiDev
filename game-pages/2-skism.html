            <h2>Game Info</h2>
            Skeletal Skism is an Online PVP Real-Time Auto Battler. Players play as a skeleton king, with
            the goal of destroying the opponent's throne.
            <hr>Players obtain gold from killing enemy units, which is used to buy items in the shop. These items have
            bonuses like damage, hitstun, and lifesteal that make the player stronger. Each side also has an Angel of
            Death they can summon
            once per game to turn the
            tide of the battle.
            <hr>In order to win, players can counter their opponent's build and adapt their strategy over the course of
            the battle. With over 50 unique items, there are over one trillion possible builds in Skeletal Skism.

            <h2>My Experience</h2>
            After developing Skeletal Skism, I learned how to create a deterministic system and how to make an online
            multiplayer
            game. I also learned a lot more about
            how to use Unity and C#, since
            this was
            the first
            real game I developed in Unity. Creating this game really helped cement my skills in creating a
            working online multiplayer game.

            <hr>Some challenges I overcame while making this game include unit animation, collision, and multiplayer
            networking. One of the toughest obstacles I faced while making this game was syncing the gameplay of both
            players. That was a large part of why I had to make the game deterministic. It also meant I had to learn how
            to
            compensate for lag and other connection problems, and handle those accordingly.
