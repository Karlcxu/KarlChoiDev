            <h2>Game Info</h2>
            Skeletal Skism is an online PVP Real-Time Tactics Autobattler. Each player plays as a skeleton king, with the goal of destroying the opponent's throne.
            <hr>Players obtain gold from slaying the opposing side's units and can use this gold to grow more powerful by purchasing items in the shop. These items have interesting bonuses like hitstun,
            range, lifesteal, and more. Each side also has an Angel of Death they can summon once per game to turn the tide of the battle.
            <hr>In order to win, players must counter their opponent's build and adapt their strategy over the course of the battle. With over 50 unique items, there are over one trillion different builds you can implement to destroy your enemies.

            <h2>My Experience</h2>
            Things I learned from working on this game include how to create a deterministic system, make a multiplayer game, and plan out feature implementation. Creating this game really helped cement my skills in creating a working online multiplayer game.
            
            <hr>Some challenges I overcame while making this game include unit animation, collision, and multiplayer networking. One of the toughest things I faced while making this game was syncing the gameplay of both players. This means I had to learn how to 
            compensate for lag and other connection problems, and handle those accordingly.
