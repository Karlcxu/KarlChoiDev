            <h2>Game Info</h2>
            Skeletal Skism 2 is an Online PVP Real-Time Auto Battler, and a sequel to Skeletal Skism (2022).
            <hr>Skism 2 includes many new features/mechanics like a faction system, vault system, a new mercenary unit,
            an online leaderboard, and more.
            <hr>For game modes, this sequel adds a singleplayer campaign mode and an improved training mode.
            <hr>Aside from new mechanics and features, 25 new items were added.

            <h2>My Experience</h2>
            Skeletal Skism 2 is the biggest solo project I have worked on, which means I had to learn how to work
            with and expand on a large codebase. It also improved my ability to polish a game, in terms of not only
            visuals, but also user experience.

            <hr>The biggest challenge I faced while developing the sequel, like the prequel, was ensuring that the game
            was deterministic so that desyncs
            would
            not
            occur. I had to consider this whenever I added a new mechanic to the game, but I was able to add
            the mechanics I had planned: and keep the game deterministic. Lastly, coming up with new and
            creative ways to make the sequel better than the
            first game while still being accessible was definitely tricky - but in the end, I think I hit a good balance
            of
            complexity and accessibility.
